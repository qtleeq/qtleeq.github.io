My name is Taylor Lee. I am a long time resident of The Cove Condominiums in Madison, Wisconsin. Bordered by Shorewood Hills, Eagle Heights and Lake Mendota, The Cove offers a unique living experience in that it is in central Madison, minutes from the UW-Madison campus, the State Capital and downtown Madison, yet is surrounded by a wooded area called the Lakeshore Nature Preserve.
