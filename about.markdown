My name is Taylor Lee. I am a long time resident of The Cove Condominiums in Madison, Wisconsin. Bordered by Shorewood Hills, Eagle Heights and Lake Mendota, The Cove offers a unique living experience in that it is in central Madison, minutes from the UW-Madison campus, the State Capital and downtown Madison, yet is surrounded by the a wooded area called the Lakeshore Nature Preserve.


Unfortunetly, for over ten years, the Cove has employed a janitor whose behavior has steadily become more erratic, hostile and violent. Paul Vaccaro is little more than a lowlife biker thug who bullies, harasses, intimidates and even attacks residents who stand in opposition to his ambitions of living at the Cove and doing minimal work. He has chosen my Mother and I for harassment and torment because he desperately wants to live at the Cove and have a family and we have rejected him. In retaliation, he harasses us by singing outside of our unit, shouting in the hallway and making loud noises by slamming down equipment throughout the day. He is a threat to public safety and I fear for the safety of myself and my Mother. It is extremely upsetting, and we are far from the only ones at the Cove to have disturbing experiences with him. In fact, many people have moved away from the Cove only get away from him, and as a previous member of the board of directors stated, "many people even take breaks from living at the Cove out of fear for their safety."


Paul Vaccaro has ruined the experience of living at the Cove. I started this blog to get my life back and protect my family. This blog, and its sister website [Shorewood Hills Violence Alert](http://shorewoodhillsviolencealert.github.io), shall expose the sadist tendencies of this sick and cruel individual.
