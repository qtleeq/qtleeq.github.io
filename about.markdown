My name is Taylor Lee. In May of 2017, I gave Donald Trump, the NSA and US Cyber Command a unique idea. I told them to create as many Instagram accounts as possible, to build up followings of regular Americans, and then to use these accounts to repost and draw interest to a mysterious identity posting anonomously on Anime Imageboard like 4Chan. This mysterious identity should call himself Q, or QAnon, and it should really be the President of the United States the entire time. While I have had nothing to do with the operation, including the content the President has posted as Q, I suggested this technique after realizing the Satanic Pedophile network exposed in the Pizzagate scandal was behind 9/11.
