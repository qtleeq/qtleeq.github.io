This blog was started by long-time Cove resident Taylor Lee to get Cove Janitor and violent biker thug Paul Vaccaro fired for his numerous acts of violence and harassment. The strategic decision has been made to focus on his attack on Sara Matthews. He saw her unloading her car in the Cove garage and left a ladder flat on the floor of a stopped elevator hoping she would trip over it. She walked into the open elevator with groceries and tripped, dropping everything. Paul Vaccaro then stood over her and said nothing, not helping her up or apologizing, making it clear this was the result he intended when initially left the ladder flat on the floor of the elevator.


The board gave Paul Vaccaro a warning after this incident. If it had simply been an accident, which of course is mathematically impossible, they would not have disciplined him. Now that I have started two websites and am developing numerous Latex PDFs to call them out for this, I expect them to retaliate against me and my family. The absurd notion that a Cove employee should only receive a slap on the wrist for attacking a Cove resident is astonishing and remarkable. This will become a major point of embarrassment for the board, and they will try to head it off by punishing me preemptively.
