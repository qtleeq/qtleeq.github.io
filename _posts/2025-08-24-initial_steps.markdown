It is my personal quest to get Paul Vaccaro terminated from employment by the Cove for his numerous acts of violence, stalking and harassment. Getting him fired will not be an easy task; He has many allies on the board, and he spends most of his time socializing with residents, given there is very little actual work for him to do. He picks roughly five percent of residents at the Cove to antagonize, and my Mother and I have been selected by him to be his victims, simply because we don't want him in our family. It is an extremely upsetting situation, and it calls for taking drastic action, as everyday his behavior becomes more erratic and my family falls into greater danger. He is mentally unstable, and given how he has committed violent acts in the past, we can only assume he will do it again.


In planning to convince the Cove Unit Owners Association Board of Directors to terminate Paul Vaccaro, I have made a few strategic decisions regarding what our initial steps should be. First, instead of trying to paint a broad picture of Paul's misconduct and hostile behavior, I believe initially we would be best served to focus on his most egregious act of violence to date. This would be when he booby trapped an elevator with a short ladder laid flat on the ground to hurt a woman who had rejected his romantic overtures and denied him the opportunity of living at the Cove; that woman being Sara Matthews. He saw her unloading her car and correctly asserted the items she would be carrying would obstruct her vision enough to cause her to trip over a ladder placed on the floor of the elevator. I often think of her losing her balance and trying to reach out toward the ground in a desperate, hopeless attempt to protect herself from a violent landing, not knowing if her hands would land on the carpet or the ladder itself, not knowing if she would touch a flat surface or if her delicate hands and arms would be awkwardly contorted against the cruelty of Paul Vaccaro's trap.


Second, instead of trying to convince compartmentalized Cove Unit owners to apply pressure to the board to fire Vaccaro, we should reach out to the surrounding Shorewood Hills neighborhood and alert them to the presence of this violent, mentally unstable individual. My hope is that by word of mouth, news of Paul's most violent act will spread throughout Shorewood, and out of fear of being embarrassed in front of the greater Shorewood Hills community, the Cove Board of Directors will move to terminate Paul Vaccaro.


This is only the initial phase of our efforts, and we must make additional preparations. The board might be slow to react, as they only gave Paul a warning for attacking Sara Matthews, and admitting this was a highly insufficient way to respond to such a brutal assault could be embarrassing for board members. Only by making it clear that all of Shorewood Hills will learn of their handling of this incident if Paul Vaccaro is not immediately fired will the board have the opportunity to realize what their least embarrassing option is. I am preparing numerous PDF documents with Latex for distribution throughout Shorewood, both electronically and with paper copies. These include the Shorewood Hills Violence Alert Flyer at <http://shorewoodhillsviolencealert.github.io> and a longer document I am preparing with Latex's Book class called the [Shorewood Hills Violence Alert Report (SHVAR)](https://github.com/qtleeq/Shorewood-Hills-Violence-Alert-Report). I expect SHVAR to be a few hundred pages long when it is completed. It will be a complete collection of all of Paul Vaccaro's recorded violence, threats, misconduct and disturbing behavior, hopefully including many of the stories we have heard from people who formerly lived at the Cove and moved away out of fear for their safety.


I expect the board to retaliate against me for drawing attention to their inexcusable decision to acknowledge Paul Vaccaro attacked Sara Matthews and to respond not by terminating him but by giving him a warning. This will not deter me, and I will remain steadfast and continue to assure all parties that I will make the board's mortifying handling of the incident broadly known if Paul Vaccaro is not fired immediately.
