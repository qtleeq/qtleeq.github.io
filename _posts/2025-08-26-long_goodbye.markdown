Back in 2023, after I told Paul Vaccaro he was rude for singing outside of my unit, he told me to "Kiss his ass." I don't really know why he wasn't fired for saying that to a Cove resident. You would think that if he said that to one of Genevieve's grandchildren he quickly would be fired. But I guess I am a second class citizen. Because Paul is providing sex to multiple board members, I have no choice but to endure hearing about the homosexual, scatological fantasies Paul Vaccaro has with me in his head. Am I bitter that Genevieve, Jane and the rest of the board gave Paul a pass? Well, let's just say I am fine if this blog makes a few people uncomfortable.

I can't believe Jay Gold called my Mom and told her the board was thinking of calling the non-Emergency Police number on me. What could they possibly say? Did I threaten them in those emails? No, I simply wanted to know who at the Cove would serve as the contact for Shorewood residents rightly afraid for their safety. I have seen Paul driving erratically multiple times in Shorewood. In fact, on two occasions he has almost driven me off the road on Lake Mendota Drive. Jay also said he was going to get a mediator. What could we mediate? Will Paul stop harassing me if I take my blog down? Will he agree not to assault another resident? Will he apologize for making fun of me for being unemployed and living with my Mom? I have long made clear to President Trump my desire to be White House Chief of Staff, and he chose someone with the name Wiles to be his first Chief of Staff in this administration. There is a WI for Wisconsin in the name and a LE for Lee in the name. That job is mine if I can manage to bring back JFK Jr and wake up America to the truth about QAnon. Would I accept an apology from Paul? No. Not for Jay's sake, or for Genevieve's or Jane's or for anyone else who thinks Paul ought to keep his job after sexually harassing me. Would I sit down with a mediator? It would sure be interesting. Perhaps even entertaining. I am not sure what I did wrong. All I did was point out that the board was disgraceful for giving Paul a warning after he attacked Sara Matthews. He could have broken her neck made her a quadriplegic. I bet the board would have acted like it was an accident and let Paul keep his job. I'm just fucking tired of it. Goodbye Paul, you fucking creep. Sorry I didn't want to be your son. You have the ugliest face I have ever fucking seen.
