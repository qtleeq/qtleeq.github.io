I don't know who's decision it was to have Paul not come to work tomorrow, or well technically it is today, but whatever. I am so grateful to whoever decided this was necessary. I hate Paul and I don't feel safe while he is in the building. Paul didn't seem like he was scared of me on Friday or Monday. Maybe the board felt threatened when this blog came alive today and decided pretending Paul felt threatened by me would convey some sort of signal to me to stop blogging. Maybe they are afraid of people learning about Paul's violence or sexual harassment. Maybe they are scared of people learning about the board's support of Paul throughout his violence and sexual harassment. Maybe they are worried people in Shorewood will see this blog and be intrigued enough to read along as I chronicle my journey to restore resident safety and dignity to the Cove. Who knows? How cool would it be if this blog caught on in Shorewood. I made the QR code for `qtleeq.github.io`:

Should I make a flyer for this blog? What would I put on it to peak the interest of the average Shorewood resident? "Sex scandal at the Cove!", "Cove Janitor trades sex for right to go marauding through Cove!".

I think there are two board members who are sleeping with Paul. I really believe that. They are essentially using our HOA fees to pay for sex, which wouldn't be as big of a deal if Paul weren't attacking, stalking and harassing residents with reckless abandon. Let's just agree that if you are on the board and you are in a sexual relationship with Paul you have an obligation to disclose it, as there is a conflict of interest. Would it be unreasonable to demand that a Cove board member that is having a sexual relationship with a Cove employee resign from the board? I think this is a reasonable expectation to have, to expect that a board member that enters into a sexual relationship with Paul should resign from the board. There is a massive conflict of interest especially if that board member is protecting Paul while he stalks, harasses or attacks residents. Maybe I am talking myself into circles. I will finish by saying that I think Paul is sleeping with two board members, and I think they are protecting Paul despite the fact it is obvious he should have been fired a long time ago for any of a variety or reasons or incidents. It's a scandal interesting enough for people in Shorewood. I wonder if you can get a list of their emails? Maybe a few fliers would do.
