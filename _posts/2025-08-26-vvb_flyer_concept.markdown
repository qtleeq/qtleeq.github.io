Hey guys, while I am working on my Shorewood Hills Violence Alert Report for mass distribution in Shorewood (Operation Arrivederci as I call it), I thought it might be quicker to just make a simple flyer for the [Vaccaro Violence Blog](qtleeq.github.io) just like what I did for the [Shorewood Hills Violence Alert](https://shorewoodhillsviolencealert.github.io). Here is what I have so far:

So, maybe is isn't great. I could include a picture of him on a motorcycle. I will think it over. Just know I could start emailing and printing off these at any point in time. I guess I need to make the [Shorewood Hills Violence Alert](https://shorewoodhillsviolencealert.github.io) a bit more filled out with background information, kind of like a shorter, HTML version of the Shorewood Hills Violence Alert Report. Trying to think of how I want to do this. It's not even 8 yet.
