It is my personal quest to get Paul Vaccaro terminated from employement by the Cove for his numerous acts of violence and harassment. He is a threat to public safety. I fear for the safety of myself and my Mother. Getting him fired will not be an easy task. He has many allies on the board, and he spends most of his time socializing with residents, given he has very little work to do. He picks roughly five percent of residents at the Cove to antagonize, and my Mother and I have been selected by him to be his victims. We were chosen because he desperately wants to live at the Cove and have a family, and wants to be in our family and not have to commute from Fitchburg everyday. Because we have rejected him, he harasses us by singing, shouting and making loud noises throughout the day. It is extremely upsetting, and I am taking actions to get him removed from his position as Cove janitor.

I started this blog to get my life back. Paul Vaccaro has ruined the experience of living at the Cove. This blog, and its sister website [Shorewood Hills Violence Alert](http://shorewoodhillsviolencealert.github.io), shall expose the sadist tendencies of this sick and cruel individual.
