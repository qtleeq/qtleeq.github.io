Cove Unit Owners Association Board Member Jay Gold just called my Mom. I guess Paul Vaccaro is afraid of me and not going to come into work for a while. I can't believe how quickly I made the Cove a safer place to live. How can I make this permanent? Jay told me Mom they are thinking of calling non-emargency on me. I guess my emails about how they are all going to hell for giving Paul a warning for trying to assassinate Sara Matthews made them feel threatened. Going to spend time working on my Shorewood Hills Violence Alert Report now. Planning to email that to the Village of Shorewood Hills Board of Trustees by Friday. Hope no one is embarassed you gave Paul a warning for attempting homicide!
